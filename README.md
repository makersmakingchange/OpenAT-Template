SUMMARY
A brief summary of the project. What it does, who it is for, how much it costs.
 --->
The (todo:Project Title) is for making it easier to document Open-Source Assistive Technology devices. It is intended for use by makers. The device is comprised of off-the-shelf electronics and 3D printed parts. The overall cost of materials is about $8 (plus $8 for component shipping).

## Getting Started
<!--- 
Include an overall idea of what major steps are required to build the device.
 --->

### 1. Order the Off-The-Shelf Components
The [Bill of Materials](/Documentation/ProductTitle_BOM_v0.1.xlsx) lists all of the parts and components required to build the (todo:Project Title). The electronic components may be available locally, but will probably need to be ordered online. 

### 2. Print the 3D Printable components
Print the components for the switch tester case and choose an option for the case.

All of the files and individual print files can be in the [/Build_Files/3D_Printing_Files](/Build_Files/3D_Printing_Files/) folder.

### 3. Assemble the (todo:Product Title)
Reference the [assembly guide](/Documentation/ProductTitle_Assembly_Guide_v1.0.pdf) for the tools and steps required to build each portion.
